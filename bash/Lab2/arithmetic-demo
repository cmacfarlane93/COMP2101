# this script demonstrates doing arithmetic

# Task 1: Remove the assignments of numbers to the first and second number variables. Use one or more read commands to get 3 numbers from the user.
# Task 2: Change the output to only show:
#    the sum of the 3 numbers with a label
#    the product of the 3 numbers with a label

#prompting user for input, storing that input in variables
read -p "please enter first number: " firstNum
read -p "please enter second number: " secondNum
read -p "please enter third number: " thirdNum

#performing arithmetic on variables
sum=$((firstNum + secondNum + thirdNum))
product=$((firstNum*secondNum*thirdNum))

#output changed to be a little more clear
cat <<EOF
Performing Arithmetic:
Sum: $firstNum + $secondNum + $thirdNum = $sum
Product: $firstNum * $secondNum * $thirdNum = $product
